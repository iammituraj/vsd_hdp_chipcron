<summary>Installing VM box</summary>
<br>
You need to setup VM box in your system for the purpose of this workshop.

1. Follow the steps in [setting up VM box](https://github.com/iammituraj/vsd_hdp_chipcron/blob/main/week_0/support_files/setting_up_vmbox.pdf) to install VM box and create a VM with the VDI file from VSD.
2. Once the VM is created, you can verify that the VM is setup properly by powering it on.
3. Once powered on, use the default username and password to login: 
user name = _vsduser_, password = _vsdiat_
4. If successfully setup and logged in, the VM looks like this and is ready to use for the workshop!

1. The counter is compiled with an online compiler: [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org/)
2. Any of the compilers can be chosen, for eg: _RISC-V 32-bit GCC_
3. Assembly equivalent of the program can be observed:
